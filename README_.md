# 🤖 Personal Assistant (Tkinter GUI)

This project is a **desktop personal assistant** built with **Python** and **Tkinter**.  
It provides a simple graphical interface with buttons to launch different tools and applications such as calendar, contacts, music player, and more.

## 🚀 Features
- Calendar 📅  
- Contact Book 📒  
- Searcher 🔍  
- Weather Forecast ⛅  
- Email Client 📧  
- Music Player 🎵  
- Alarm / Notifications ⏰  
- News Reader 📰  
- Agenda 🗒️  
- Messaging 💬  
- Traffic Information 🚦  
- Caller ☎️  
- Task Manager ✅  

Each button runs a corresponding Python script (e.g., `Calendar.py`, `Contacts.py`, `Weather.py`, etc.).

## ⚙️ Requirements
- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter (comes pre-installed with Python)  

Additional scripts (`Calendar.py`, `Contacts.py`, etc.) may require extra libraries depending on their implementation.

## ▶️ Usage
Run the main script:
```bash
python main.py
```
This will open a **GUI window** with all the available assistant tools.  

Click on any button (e.g., *Calendar*, *Weather*, *Music Player*) to launch the respective application.

## 📌 Notes
- Each feature is modular and stored in its own Python file.  
- The assistant acts as a central hub to access multiple productivity tools.  
- You can expand functionality by adding new buttons and linking them to additional scripts.
